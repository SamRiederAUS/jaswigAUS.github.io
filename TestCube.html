      <h2>Test the Jaswig Experience for Free</h2>
      <p>
        Designing furniture is one thing. But implenting it correctly is another. We want our StandUp to have an impact on the people and their environment. If the desks don't have the desired impact it is of no use to implement them.<br><br>

        Our TesCubes are designed to make you feel what the Jaswig Experience is all about. People can feel how they interact with the table and how they like to use it.
