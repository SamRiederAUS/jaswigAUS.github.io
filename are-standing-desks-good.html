        <p>
        Our bodies are not made to do something (whatever it is) for too long at a time. Our bodies are made to change positions and to move around as much as possible. The best position is always the next position. So change positions as many as possible. A standing desks makes you do just that.
        </p>

        <h2>How can a standing desk help</h2>

        <p>
        A standing desks makes the work environment a lot more dynamic. It makes sure that you move around more often. A sitting desks stimulates people to reside in a certain position for a very long time. Sitting makes people tired and thus enhances them to keep where they are. A standing desk draws attention and makes people choose to stand up and move. This is why someone should consider a standing desk. It makes it easier to find more balance between sitting and moving around.

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Burn more calories</strong> Standing desks make people move around more and switch positions.</li>
          <li><strong>Take pressure from your spine</strong> because sitting exerts a lot of pressure on the discs present in the spine </li>
          <li><strong>Activate more and big muscle groups</strong>standing and moving around activates big muscle groups</li>
          <li><strong>Boost your blood flow</strong>because large muscle groups are activated </li>
          <li><strong>Makes you more efficient</strong>because blood flow increases which keeps you awake </li>

         <h2>Important features</h2>

        <p>
          As stated earlier, changing positions is key. So standing at a desk for too long isnâ€™t good either. That is why it is important to have a footrest on your standing desk. This feature makes it easier to change positions as, ergonomically placing a foot on a higher surfaces really is another posture. One should thus change legs as much as possible.

        <p>
          After having experimented with standing desks one could also start to increase his/her time behind a standing desk by placing a high stool behind the desk. This way one can easily hop off and on the stool and change positions even more. It is better to do this in a later stadium as it will most probably mean that you stand more throughout the day which needs a little adaptation of the body.

          Quick wrap up:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>standing takes away pressure from the discs in-between your spine</li>
          <li>a standing desk makes you move around more if implemented correctly which activates big muscles groups that take pressure of even more</li>
        </ul>
