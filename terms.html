  </p>
  <p>
    These General Conditions of Sale shall apply to all current and future sales of Products by Jaswig to the Purchaser. The Purchaser accepts these terms as well as all other rights and obligations as stated on the website by using the website and/or placing an order.
   </p>
    <p>
    These General Conditions of Sale shall be always and exclusively applicable, except in the case of an explicit derogation. An explicit derogation is only valid insofar as it is the result of a mutual agreement that is recorded in writing. Explicit derogations are only valid to replace or supplement the clauses to which they relate. This does not affect the applicability of the other provisions of these General Conditions of Sale.
   </p>
     <p>
    Jaswig reserves the right to amend and/or supplement the General Conditions of Sale in the future. A future change will obviously have no effect on existing product orders and the resulting agreements. Any amendment or supplement shall enter into force on the first day of the month following the month in which notification of that amendment or supplement was given. The Purchaser is considered to agree with the amendment or supplement of the Terms & Conditions of sale, except in case of withdrawal conform the section “withdrawal’ below. 
   </p>
   
    <p><strong>Offer and Acceptance</strong></p>
    <p>
    Our online offer is presented with utmost care. Jaswig provides information about the features of the products, including technical descriptions and photographs illustrating the products. This entirely in so far as technical means allow and in accordance with the best standards in the market. The images displayed on our website provide an accurate representation of the substantial features of our products.
   </p>
     <p>
  Our online offer is presented as an invitation to purchase. Jaswig is not bound by its offer. An offer is only valid while stocks last.
   </p>
    <p>
      To purchase a product from the Jaswig range, the Purchaser must complete our online ordering method. This purchase is binding on the Purchaser. Jaswig will send a confirmation of the order within seven (7) calendar days, directed at the e-mail address specified by the Purchaser at the moment of ordering. The sale contract shall be concluded as soon as the Purchaser has received the order confirmation email issued by Jaswig.
   </p>
   <p>
     Jaswig retains the possibility to refuse the sending of an order confirmation email or to unilaterally reject an order placement by means of an explicit statement. Jaswig will inform the Purchaser if the initial order cannot be executed. There is no Sales contract if Jaswig refuses the order. In such case, all payments that have been made will be soon refunded. The Purchaser is not entitled to any form of compensation.
   </p>
     <p>
     The Parties expressly acknowledge that the use of different types of electronic communications, such as email, give rise to a valid agreement. This is fully consistent with the Act of March 11, 2003 on electronic trading. Within the limits of what is permitted by law, Jaswig can make use of all electronic files available to prove the existence of the Sales contract. An ordinary digital or electronic qualified signature is not an essential requisite proof.
   </p>
   
   <p><strong>Pricing</strong></p>
    <p>
     All prices are indicated in EURO and include VAT and other taxes. The individual product price does not include the costs of delivery and other additional costs. Jaswig will communicate these costs in the last step of our online ordering process.
   </p>
   <p>
    The price as displayed on the confirmation of order is the final price to be paid, barring the exception of article 2 relating to Prices. Obvious errors in pricing, such as obvious inaccuracies (e.g. more than 10% price difference compared to the average sales price of the past 3 months), can still be corrected by Jaswig after the conclusion of the sales contract. The Purchaser must communicate any complaints regarding the pricing or the payment within seven (7) calendar days after the confirmation of order, in writing. The filing of a complaint does not suspend due payments.
   </p>
   <p>
    We have the right to change our prices at any time but commit to always apply the prices that were indicated on our website at the time of your order, unless there were inaccuracies in the pricing of the Products. In such case, the rules above apply and the Price to be paid, shall be the price in the confirmation of order. Price changes that are due to changes in VAT rates will be borne by the Purchaser.
   </p>
     <p>
   The use of certain selected payment methods can entail additional costs, which are exclusively borne by the Purchaser.
   </p>
    <p>
  Invoices will only be provided to legal entities (B2B) on request. Consumers are expressly excluded thereof and will therefor not be able to request an invoice.
   </p>
   
   <p><strong>Payment</strong></p>
    <p>
   Each payment is handled promptly and completely, i.e. when the Purchaser places his order. We accept the payment methods as indicated on our website:
   </p>
    <p>
   Mastercard
   VISA
   AmericanExpress
   Paypal
   Discover
   JCB
   Bancontact
   Mister Cash
   </p>
    <p>
  Jaswig has taken all reasonable measures to ensure safe payments. Our main concerns are a loss or theft of your identity or financial information. The use of the above mentioned authorized payment partners and credit card issuers provide the necessary guarantees.
   </p>
   <p>
  We make use of the secured payment system Mollie or Stripe for the further processing of the payment. This closed security system processes your bank details always in an encrypted manner. Security measures via the SSL protocol are provided.
   </p>
   <p>
  Jaswig shall only deliver the order as soon as it has received the full payment of all amounts owed by the Purchaser. Jaswig always retain ownership of all products ordered until full payment of all amounts due under this Agreement has been made, regardless whether the delivery has already occurred.
   </p>
   
   <p><strong>Delivery and Installation</strong></p>
    <p>
  We process every order with the care it deserves. The order shall be processed within eight (8) weeks upon order confirmation. Jaswig has the right to stipulate wider delivery terms, which shall be communicated within a reasonable timespan after the order confirmation. The Purchaser may only terminate the agreement if Jaswig fails to deliver the products within the communicated delivery deadline. In the event of such termination, Jaswig will reimburse all sums paid without undue delay and no later than fourteen (14) calendar days after termination of the agreement.
   </p>
    <p>
  Jaswig uses external parties and carriers for the execution of the delivery. This may have an effect on the delivery. Jaswig takes however no responsibility for delivery arriving late or for an order which is lost by third parties or by unforeseen circumstances or force majeure. If an order that has been sent remains undelivered, Jaswig will conduct an investigation at the carrier’s end. This can take several days. During this period, Jaswig cannot provide any reimbursement or proceed to a re-delivery of the products. 
   </p>
    <p>
 The Purchaser is responsible to make the delivery possible at the indicated address, either by being present himself or by designating a third-party present at the indicated address at the moment of the delivery. A delivery is performed as soon as the ordered products are offered one time at the indicated address. If a delivery is unsuccessful due to a failure by the Purchaser or by the third party designated by the Purchaser, the cost of this delivery attempt is fully borne by the Purchaser.
   </p>
     <p>
 Jaswig bears the risk for damage and/or loss of the products until the moment of delivery. Risk associated with the goods shall pass from Jaswig to the Purchaser on delivery. Each delivery requires a signature of the delivery confirmation, but a lack of signature does not affect the transfer of risk.
   </p>
   <p><strong>Defects and Complaints</strong></p>
    <p>
 The statutory warranty period, as provided in Articles 1641 to 1649 of the Belgian Civil Code, is fully applicable to this agreement. Each Purchaser is consequently entitled to repair or replacement if he finds a defect in the delivered products, to the extent that the requirements of the legal warranty are satisfied. The Consumer enjoys furthermore a statutory warranty period of fifty (50) years on the structural purpose of all parts manufactured by Jaswig out of 18mm Russian Birch Plywood except for the footrest. On the footrest and on all other parts the Consumer enjoys furthermore a statutory warranty period of two (2) years (Article 1649bis – 1649quinquies Belgian Civil Code). The warranty is not applicable if the Purchaser was aware of the defects at the time of the sale. 
   </p>
     <p>
The Purchaser or the third party designated by the Purchaser is required to examine the products accurately on their conformity as soon as the products are received. If the product is affected by a visible defect, and the receiver perceives this defect, he must submit a complaint. Purchaser shall communicate these complaints towards Jaswig in a written statement and in an explicit, unambiguous and motivated manner. This must be done within seven (7) days upon delivery. It is the duty of the Purchaser to motivate this communication sufficiently. We require a statement that uses all reasonable technical resources, such as photos and videos. 
   </p>
        <p>
The Purchaser must send the defective products back to Jaswig in their original condition, including packaging, accessories and documentation, and always accompanied by the original invoice or a valid proof of payment. Any deficiency in this obligation will imply a proportional reduction in the repayment. All costs for return shipment shall be borne by the Purchaser. Sending back an order is always at risk of the Purchaser. We recommend a registered and insured return shipment to avoid the risks of loss and theft. This return shipment must be done within seven (7) calendar days after the communication. 
   </p>
    <p>
The warranty is not applicable in case of: 
   </p>
   <p>
(a) Damage caused by normal wear and tear; accidental or intentional changes caused by the Purchaser to the product, including improper and incorrect use; exposure to moisture, fire, earthquake or other external causes.
(b) Damage caused during the installation and/or caused by a use that is not in accordance with the instructions and information provided. These instructions and information can also be provided via electronic communication channels.
   </p>
    <p>
The Purchaser shall not be entitled to send back the products in the absence of a substantiated complaint. If the conditions of warranty are met, the Purchaser is firstly entitled to a free repair or replacement of the ordered products, if the situation renders it possible. Jaswig is only held to a reimbursement if the reparation or replacement no longer produces the same benefit for the Purchaser. The Purchaser will have to communicate this ground in a clear and motivated manner. Any compensation and reimbursement can never exceed the amount invoiced to the Purchaser. 
   </p>
   
    <p>
If the products have been sent back although the conditions were not met, Jaswig will send the products to the Purchaser back again. The cost of this shipment will be borne by the Purchaser. Jaswig may stock the returned products at third parties, for account and at the risk of the Purchaser, as long as the costs of return have not been paid.
