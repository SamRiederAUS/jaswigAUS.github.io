          <p>
            Listening to customers is important as a company. The product that is presented on this page is an example of this. People kept asking for a simple but beautiful table at which they could hold efficient meetings while standing. And that is exactly what we have tried to make!<br><br>
          </p>

          <h2>Why should you meet while standing</h2>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Meetings take less time</li>
              <li>More dynamic and interactive athmosphere</li>
              <li>More attentive people around the table</li>
            </ul>
