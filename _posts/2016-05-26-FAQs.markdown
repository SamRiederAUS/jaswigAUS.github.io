### What is the size range of the desk and how tall should I be?

The height range of the StandUp Nomad (normal and extra wide version) is 36.5 – 48 inch or 93 – 122 cm. The height can be [manually adjusted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey0lu2gvmB4) with 9 increments, each one of approx. 1.3” or 3.2 cm. No need for pumps or electricity. 
Although not everyone has the same body dimensions, the desk should be perfect for people between 4’11” and 6’6” or 1.5 and 2 m. This is assuming you are standing at your desk with 90°-bend elbows. 

### Difference in desktop size
Our StandUp Nomad comes with two desktop sizes. 
The normal version is more compact: 20 x 25.5 inch or 50 x 65 cm
Perfect for working with a laptop, or reading your journal 
The Extra Wide version: 21.5 x 31.5 inch 55 x 80 cm
Perfect for working with a laptop and a notebook, or including a monitor.
