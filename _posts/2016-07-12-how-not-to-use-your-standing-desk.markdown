### How you can use your deks wrongly

Some tips on how NOT to use your desk, so that it keeps you healthy!
<!--more-->

**Stand for 2h plus without interruption**
At Jaswig we believe in a healthy thus well-balanced lifestyle. Doing something for too long at a time is always bad. Even standing :). We recommend a slow ramp up of your hours worked while standing. ALWAYS LISTEN TO YOUR BODY. 

**Wear high heals**
Standing on heals is not the best thing to do. So if you are standing behind your desk please take of your heals and give your feet some rest. 

**Stand straight without switching positions**
Standing without changing your posture is bad. Use the footrest your desk is provided with or if you don’t have a footrest put your leg on your chair and stretch a little while standing. This increases your activity let you change positions, which is key!

We always have the tendency to fix our position in our joints. It is always better to use your muscles in every possible situation (burns more calories and strengthens your muscles). Check out his little video to see what I mean. It’s not very easy to see but try and you will feel what I mean.

**Use it at the same height as your colleagues**
Everyone has different lengths. Please adjust the height of your desk to your own personal height this makes a big difference in usage and is the base for a good posture.
